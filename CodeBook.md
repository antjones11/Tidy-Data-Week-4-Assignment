The variables presented in the tidydata.txt consist of the following:

2 Factor variables:
Activity - a factor variable consisting of 6 different activities WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING

Participant - a factor variable consisting with one of 30 levels identifying a participant

66 measurement variables that are an average for each participant performing a single activity over a number of different trials. Only the measurements with "std()" or "mean()" are included in this analysis. For the purpose of this assignment variables with "Mean" in their titles were not included. 

The measurement variables are split into time domain signals (prefix with 't') and frequency domain (prefix with 'f').  The variables marked XYZ consist of 3 consecutive components: X, Y, and Z.  A full list of the variables are listed below:
